In developing coutries, the inequality between urban and rural health care is a serious issue. This is due to the shortage of qualified healthcare providers/trained specialists to examine the results. Or, Inability to diagnoise at early stages of the disease. We have developed an application that can be used in remote localities/camps to screen patients for cataract disease and provide treatment to the less privileged ones. And thus bridging the gap between urban and rural medical access.
